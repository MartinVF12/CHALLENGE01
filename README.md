In this exercise, a marketing company hired us to refactor the code, enhancing its visual appeal and improving accessibility for users to access these resources more effectively.

While the primary focus is on improving code structure, refactoring can also lead to performance improvements. Clear and well-organized code is often more optimized, and developers can identify and address performance bottlenecks during the refactoring process.
Refactoring is essential for building and maintaining robust, adaptable, and high-quality software. It is a practice that not only improves efficiency in the short term but also lays the foundation for the long-term success of any software development project. This is a is an ongoing process, and it's often done iteratively as the code evolves. It's a fundamental practice in software development that contributes to the overall health and longevity of a project.
